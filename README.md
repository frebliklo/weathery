# Weathery - a small weather app with React!

With weathery you can find out what the weather is like at any specified location. The app uses Google Maps and [Dark Sky API](https://darksky.net/dev) to fetch the weather.

### Running locally

To get this running you'll need API keys for Google Maps and Dark Sky. Place them in a keys file in the `src` folder.
